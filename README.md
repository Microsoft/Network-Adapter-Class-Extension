## Goals for this project

### Learning from the source

Unsure about what a particular NetAdapterCx method is doing? Take a look at the
source. Our aim is to make the inner workings of NetAdapterCx as transparent
for developers as possible.

*Note: As you experiment with NetAdapterCx, you may come across undocumented
 behavior or APIS. We strongly advise against taking dependencies on
 that behavior as it's subject to change in future releases.*
